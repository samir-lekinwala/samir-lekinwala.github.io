      <h1>Cultural Blog - Introducing Te Whare Tapa Whā</h1>
      <p>
        Te Whare Tapa Whā is a model of the 4 dimensions of wellbeing developed
        by Tā Mason Durie in 1984 to provide a Māori perspective on health.
      </p>
      <p>The 4 dimensions are:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>taha tinana (physical wellbeing)</li>
        <li>taha hinengaro (mental wellbeing)</li>
        <li>taha wairua (spiritual wellbeing)</li>
        <li>taha whānau (family wellbeing)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        With 4 walls, the wharenui is a symbol of these 4 dimensions. The
        wharenui has connections to the whenua (land, sea, natural world) which
        forms the foundations for the four dimensions
      </p>

          <td>Taha Tinana (Physical Wellbeing)</td>
          <td>
            I used to exercise but stopped around 6 months ago. Not on purpose
            but work was getting in the way. I have some gym equipment and a
            rowing machine at my home. I will aim to help my physical wellbeing
            by exercising. Something I know I need to pick back up and do
            because doing these exercises is what has helped me in the past to
            feel confident and refreshed. It only makes sense to pick it back up
            and feel the effects of those chemicals activating in my body.

          <td>Taha Whānau (Family Wellbeing)</td>
          <td>
            Every weekday I spend time with my family and every weekend I also
            spend time with my extended family and some friends. These help me
            stay sane because if it wasn’t for them at the moment I would only
            be studying and only studying.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Taha Hinengaro (Emotional and Mental Wellbeing)</td>
          <td>
            My emotional state and mental state is dependant on me getting my
            ‘me time’. Currently I don’t get this so much because of the
            situation that my family is currently going through but I can see
            the benefit. I only get alone time from what feel slike 12am at
            night till when I decide I should go to bed.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Taha Wairua (Spiritual Wellbeing)</td>
          <td>
            I’m not a spiritual person. I’m atheist so don’t have any beliefs. I
            don’t think that this pillar applies to me.
          </td>

        <tr>
          <td>Whenua (Interconnections to the land and environment)</td>
          <td>
            While studying, I occasionally look outside my window which looks
            out towards the waitakere ranges. It’s not much. But it’s nice.
