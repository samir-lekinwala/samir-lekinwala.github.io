      <h1>Javascript Fundamentals</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to the next instalment of my technical series of blogs. Today
        I’m going to be writing about Javascript.
      </p>
      <p>
        Javascript is a programming language unlike HTML and CSS. If we consider
        HTML as the foundation and framing of a house and CSS as the internal
        styling of the house then we can consider Javascript as being the
        functions in the house, or what you can do in the house. You can change
        the way the house functions. For e.g if your house is already built then
        you can use Javascript to alter the house after it’s already been built.
        Similar to a renovation! But you can go as far as altering the
        foundations and styling of the house after it’s already been built, or
        you can even use Javascript to build the entire house from scratch if
        you please! If you change your mind you can once again change it
        dynamically. For e.g if your house was already built but you don’t like
        wall between your kitchen and your living room then tear it down with
        Javascript! It’s essentially renovating but you’ve got some of the best
        tools in the world to work with and it’s only a matter of your own
        imagination for what your house looks like and functions are like in the
        end.
      </p>
      <p>
        So as I’ve explained, Javascript can allow you to change the
        fundamentals of the house and bring life to it. The possibilities are
        almost endless. It gives a lot of flexibility whereas HTML and CSS are a
        bit more rigid and don’t allow for much dynamic change.
      </p>
      <p>
        These changes are done using what we call the DOM or Document Object
        Model. The browser allows us to access and use various datapoints on
        websites. Using these datapoints we can change the way the website
        functions/looks. For e.g say you want to change the colour of the
        background when a user clicks on the page. Well, you could insert a
        piece of code that attaches to a datapoint in the DOM that changes the
        background based on the user clicking the mouse. As seen below.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/js-fundamentals/background-to-red.png" />
      <p>
        In this instance, upon clicking within the body area of the website, the
        page will turn from the default white to red. That’s not the most
        exciting thing to demonstrate but this just goes to show the
        functionality of Javascript. What this Javascript code has done is it
        has taken the HTML code using the DOM and added a style attribute with
        background-color: red. This code dynamically changed the code of the
        HTML and inserted it in when a click event happened on the body of the
        page.
      </p>
      <p>See the HTML code change as soon as I clicked within the website.</p>
      <div class="sideBySide">
        <img
          class="sidebyside1"
          src="/images/js-fundamentals/before function.png"
        />
        <img
          class="sidebyside2"
          src="/images/js-fundamentals/after function.png"
        />
      </div>
      <p>
        This example was all done with what is called a function. A function is
        a set of instructions that is told to the browser when it has been
        activated. Only once this function has been activated will the events
        transpire.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/js-fundamentals/background-to-red-highlight.png" />
      <p>
        In our example we can see at the top I have declared the function as
        ‘changeBackground’ with content within it. On the very last line I have
        activated the function by typing in the code changeBackground() within
        the Javascript code. What this will mean is as soon as the website is
        loaded, this function will already be running, and the chain of events
        should be happening. It was only now waiting for me to click my mouse
        button on the screento start the next piece of instructions. The click
        of the mouse button then sparks another function, this was to turn the
        background color to red. So really, using functions is just like having
        a chain of events happen based on your given instructions when you
        request for them to happen or when you designed it to activate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let’s also look at what is called control flow. Control flow is
        essentially the order of which the code is being run. In most cases code
        is run from top to bottom. However, with javascript the control flow can
        be dependant on when the code is being told to run. Javascript might
        initially be reading code from top to bottom, like how we read a book.
        But using something like a loop can disrupt the flow. The control flow
        will change. A function at the bottom of your page can callback
        functions at the top of your page. It’s quite flexible. Think of it like
        reading a book that has the added feature of being a ‘pick your own
        adventure’ type of feature where after reading the page, you’re asked to
        choose an option and flip to page x. In this case the control flow is
        not giving an option, it’s forcing the code to jump pages, backwards or
        forwards depending on your code. This can be seen in a loop very
        clearly. Loops will continue to run the code until it is told to stop.
        The batch of code will run top to bottom, top to bottom as many times as
        its been told.
      </p>
      <img class="controlFlow" src="/images/js-fundamentals/control-flow.png" />
      <p>
        We also can’t forget objects and arrays. These are two different types
        of data storing mechanisms. Objects store keys with values and arrays
        simply store values. To me it makes sense to store data as an object if
        you plan to have multiple properties in said object. For example you
        could add in the name of a person and their age and when you attempt to
        access the variable in your browser, it will show you the properties and
        the values of the properties. See examples below.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/js-fundamentals/objects and arrays.png" />
      <p>
        The object has two properties, one for name and one for age. Both have
        their own values attached to it and can be accessed as a whole or
        individually. If you want to just access the objects name and find out
        what it is you could type in console.log(object.name) and that will show
        you ‘Samir’
      </p>
      <img src="/images/js-fundamentals/object-name.png" />
      <p>
        On the other hand arrays are very simple. The array has an index that
        starts at 0, this index is for the values that are stored in the array.
        For example our array above shows that there are two values ‘Samir’ and
        ‘30’. You can once again access these values individually or altogether.
        If you want to access the entire array you can simply say
        console.log(array) and it will print out in the console
      </p>
      <img src="/images/js-fundamentals/array consolelog.png" />
      <p>
        If you want to access the ‘30’ in the array you can type in
        console.log(array[1]) to see the contents come up in the console.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/js-fundamentals/array age.png" />
      <p>
        These are just some of the fundamental components of Javascript. There
        are a lot more but unfortunately my knowledge only goes so far at this
        current point. Fortunately, this gives me a lot of room to grow and
        knowing that I have these fundamentals on hand will surely help me
        understand Javascript just that tiny bit better.
