      <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>
      <p class="question">What is Emotional Intelligence?</p>
      <p class="answer">
        Emotional intelligence also known as EQ is the ability to control,
        assess, identity and understand your own emotions, as well as others.
      </p>
      <p class="question">How is EQ different to IQ?</p>
      <p class="answer">
        IQ is derived from doing test to assess your raw processing power. It
        does not include how well you understand others, or yourself and how to
        control your own emotions. IQ does not change all too much over the
        course of your life, but EQ is something that can be built on through
        education.
      </p>
      <p class="question">Why is EQ important?</p>
      <p class="answer">
        EQ is important because raw IQ is not enough to be successful, having
        high IQ does not help you understand or assess your own emotions and
        others. Without understanding others, you are likely to not be able to
        have very good social skills amongst peers. You might be technically
        smart, but you could end up being somewhat of a jerk without EQ. Many
        leaders in todays world all are quite adept with their EQ which further
        proves that it is not required to have a high IQ, but rather a high EQ
        to be successful. Having a high EQ will help not only with being a
        leader but being part of a team and keeping good relations going.
