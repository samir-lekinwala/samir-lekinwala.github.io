      <h1>Core Reflection</h1>
      <p class="question">
        What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
        due to the core learning?
      </p>
      <ol class="orderedList">
        <li class="answer">
          I’ve learnt that I just rush into the task instead of properly
          understanding the components and then come out with a rushed answer.
        </li>
        <li class="answer">
          I tended to just want to get through with the core learning because it
          felt like it was a barrier for me getting to get back to coding.
          Personally I struggle with remembering
        </li>
        <li class="answer">
          Reflection is a key aspect of understanding yourself and helps you
          cement knowledge. I seem to overlook this a lot.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p class="question">
        What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
        programming?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        Understanding your own values influences our behaviour when we are
        learning and programming. For example, having a growth value will allow
        you to seek out answers rather than saying it’s impossible and throwing
        a hissy fit. If you understand you have a growth value you will know
        that if you don’t understand something right now, it’s ok. Empathy and
        self-awareness come hand in hand, you need to look out for others and do
        things in a way that other will also understand. If we look at our code
        and we only write code for ourselves no one else is likely to understand
        it very easily. However, if we write it with the awareness of others
        looking over it at some point in time, we will see that we change the
        way we learn and code.
      </p>
      <p class="question">
        What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        The importance of neuroplasticity and having a growth mindset. These are
        things that I am trying to use to utilise my potential.
      </p>
      <p class="question">
        What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        I think the parts that didn’t interest me all too much were challenging.
        These would be the ones I may end up just doing them for the sake of
        doing them. I end up losing focus and spend longer than I need to
        because I tend to get distracted.
      </p>
      <p class="question">
        Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
        focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        Understanding who we are as a person and the aspects that will help us
        work with others and grow are important aspects to learning.
      </p>
      <p class="question">
        Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of
        time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming
        instead? Justify your answer.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        I won’t say that the entirety of the core exercises was a waste of time
        but yes, I do believe that there were chunks of it where I thought my
        time should be more focused on coding. The more I code the more that
        gets stuck in my head and I can feel my focus was dwindling when it came
        to the core exercises. If the core exercises were once every 2 weeks
        rather than every week personally, I think I would have benefitted more.
        This is not a dig to say what is being done is wrong, this is how I
        personally benefit from learning. I learn by doing practical work for
        long periods of time. I spent the entire day yesterday coding and at the
        end of the day I achieved what I set out to do, which was complete the
        carnival challenges. I felt like I gained quite a bit of experience from
        the shear number of hours spent coding, debugging, refactoring etc. Then
        I go to do the core exercises... Every time I finish doing the core
        exercises and go back to coding, I feel like my mind is blank. For me to
        have this stuff stick I need to continue to code at every opportunity I
        can. Unfortunately, that can also mean without interruption in my focus.
