      <h1>Technical Blog - Problem Solving</h1>
      <p>
        I was blocked on sooooo many occasions while doing the kata challenges.
        Each time you do one, your skills are meant to get ever so slightly
        better. Repetition of these task is what will drill into how to solve
        issues. In saying that, I found that although I have completed all the
        mandatory kata challenges, I am not feeling very satisfied or rewarded.
        I had a massive problem with not being able to resolve the kata
        challenges in a very timely manner. A lot of it might be due to
        misunderstanding, lack of knowledge and my brain not functioning,
        essentially like I hit a brick wall. I felt bad while doing the
        challenges, something that I might have been able to resolve earlier on
        in my studying journey I was not able to resolve in a timely manner.
        There was a lot of googling involved and a lot of testing, checking test
        scripts, writing new pseudocode, talking through the problem as if I was
        talking to a duck. Some of these techniques did help me. Specifically,
        there was one issue where I had to capitalize the first letter of every
        word in a sentence. This should be an extremely easy kata to do. I spent
        about 3 hours or more on it… It really did put me down a bit. I’m not
        sure how much I learned from these kata challenges because I kept
        thinking about how long it’s taking me to do the challenge that I don’t
        get time to reflect on what I just learnt how to do. It’s a real shame.
        Maybe I need to slow myself down a bit.

        I think I did well on the fizzbuzz/super-fizzbuzz challenges. Because I
        was familiar with the modulus operator from other challenges in the past
        I knew what to do. It was just a matter of putting it all into code. My
        pseudo code I made for this was almost spot on. The only real problem I
        had was getting the super-fizzbuzz challenges case insensitive ‘buzz’
        word being recognized. I ended up using a regex expression to solve it.
        That was the part that took the longest probably. I learnt through this
        challenge that the pseudocode really does work. It’s good to have a plan
        in place and work with it. I also found in one of my codes when I was
        trying to figure out why doesn’t it work.. I started talking to myself
        and explaining what I was trying to do, next thing I knew I managed to
        solve the problem. This challenge was one of the only ones that I felt a
        little bit good about.

        I’m confident in using all the different type of techniques to problem
        solve. The issue is even though I may use all the different techniques,
        I’m not always understanding the code and what’s being asked. Sometimes
        the wording of the problem to resolve catches me and I go down the wrong
        rabbit-hole.
      </p>

        I was reluctant to ask for help at every point in this challenge. Every
        challenge I did I attempted on my own and due to that there were parts
        that maybe I could have done faster had I asked for help. But I think
        the issue I have is that I’m not able to explain things very clearly to
        people, quite possibly because I don’t understand the issue at hand. So,
        I hesitate asking anyone for assistance and just keep attempting it on
        my own. I should probably ask people for help, this will help me also
        get better at understanding something and also will be able to get help
        on something I am stuck on.
