      <h2>So what is the Sales Ledger?</h2>
      <p>The sales ledger was designed to be the one-stop place for you to enter in your sales from various buy/sell pages that incur or don't incur fees. It helps you get an understanding of how much you have made with and without fees. This is something I already do in Excel but I thought it was a really good idea to do as a personal project. For now the site is only in the MVP stages and so only can provide data for Trademe with fees at 7.9% and Facebook at no fees. It can only also just apply your sales data. Not your buying data. This is something I'd like to implement in the future if I continue the project.</p>
      <p>I had a good time doing this project. I started off by hopping on a photo editor to just quickly design something I thought would be ok as a MVP for a mobile webpage. After creating the basic design I used that as a template of main part of the website. The table that comes on the bottom of the screen was not something I had initially designed but I managed to make it work.</p>
      <p>For this project I actually used the Bulma frame work. It was a little bit finnicky and hard to understand how to use it at times but I got the hang of it..slightly. I think if I were to do this project again I would use bootstrap because it's more widely used and probably has more documentation. A lot of the css was me just having to do trial and error because I couldn't get it to how I wanted it initially. The Bulma framework was sometimes good, sometimes bad. But I would say that's a user error from my part lol.</p>
      <p>The javascript in this project is fairly simple, nothing too crazy. The most difficult part was just creating the table dynamically with the input/output elements after a user hits the save button. I find it really quite funny how something that looks so simple actually ends up being quite hard for me to implement. Maybe in the future I'll do it quicker? Let's hope so.</p>
