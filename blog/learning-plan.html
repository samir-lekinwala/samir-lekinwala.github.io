      <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
      <p class="question">1. What is your long term goal or career pathway?</p>
      <p class="answer">
        My long term goal/career pathway is to literally get my foot in the door
        in the IT sector. Once I’ve landed at least one job using the skills I
        have learned during the course I will be able to continue to improve my
        skills and become even more employable. To me I would think that landing
        the first job doing web development is going to be the toughest hurdle
        but I have high hopes that I can do this. I’m not chasing for money, I
        am chasing for knowledge and building a skillset to become employable.
      </p>
      <p class="question">
        2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
        learning
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        Doing this course has opened my eyes a bit. There are times that I
        struggle to get something to work. E.g I was working on getting a
        dropdown menu on my blog to work for too many hours. Sometimes things
        don’t click in my head straight away. They can take time. I will
        eventually understand how to get it to work. But I also might forget it
        over time if I haven’t made use of it. My strengths in this sense would
        be persistence. I knew I wanted to get the dropdown menu to work so I
        continued to chug along to get it going. My limitations would be not
        always understanding something from the get-go. I might lose my focus
        for a bit here and there and then have to read over/watch the same
        material a few times.
      </p>
      <p class="question">
        3. What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        I’m not very good at explaining things. This is definitely something I
        want to work on. Some people seem to be naturally good at explaining
        issues or telling stories but I don’t think I’m there yet. I want to
        improve my explaining abilities so I can be on par with everyone else.
      </p>
      <p class="question">
        4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
        This should include: o An explanation of how you will manage yourself to
        work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and
        industry/community representatives o What you will do when things are
        building up and starting to get to you
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        I’m currently keeping up with the course contents because I have done
        some self-studying but from here on out I plan to ramp up the number of
        hours I spend studying. It’s very unlucky because as soon as the course
        started, my family has had some bad events unfold, this cut majorly into
        my study time. I’ve had to become a night owl and do my studies with
        around 4-5 hours of sleep a night. I want to give 100% of my time and
        focus to the course because I want the most out of it. Fortunately,
        there might be a little bit of light at the end of the tunnel and I
        should be able to ramp up my hours to study. I am also quite flexible
        and will make it work no matter what I have to do. It’s been tough but
        I’ve managed to work around the issues that have arisen so far so let
        that be a testament to my commitment to this course. If the course
        contents are stressing me out it will be best to take a short break and
        then come back to it. I sometimes find that when I’ve come back from a
        break I have a bit of a clearer mind. Because of the nature of the
        course and interacting with other students and facilitators it is
        necessary to be in a good mood and be approachable. This will require
        good amounts of sleep and breaks to keep the mind happy.

        If things get more tough, that’s ok. As long as I can keep my chin up
        and understand that the struggle may only be temporary and there will be
        a light at the end of the tunnel I can keep going.

      <p class="question">
        5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        When necessary, I will talk to/message appropriate members of the team
        for assistance. As I’ve found in the past, struggling on a problem for a
        long period of time is not exactly efficient. For the most part
        everything is available through google, I just need to seek it out and
        understand the content and apply it.
      </p>
      <p class="question">
        6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        I expect the facilitation team to keep us on our toes. Strive to get the
        best from us and understand not everyone will be comprehending the
        content at the same pace (not that you guys don’t).
      </p>
      <p class="question">
        7. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
        committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau
        commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        Besides for my current family affairs there’s nothing else that will be
        taking out time from my day. The family issues are at a point now where
        I have to visit lawyers, prepare documents etc. But those events
        shouldn’t be lasting for too much longer (hopefully).
