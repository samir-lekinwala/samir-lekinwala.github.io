      <h2>Research Neuroplasticity</h2>
      <p class="question">
        How does understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefit people?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        Being able to understand that that just the act of using our brains to
        imagine being able to do something gives you a higher chance of being to
        achieve said task.
      </p>
      <p class="question">
        How might you engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own
        benefit?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        Imagine solving problems, not only while doing the task at hand in front
        of you but during any random times in the day.
      </p>
      <p class="question">
        What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        Do a task multiple times to make the neurons connection stronger. You
        must build wide roads, not small ones when it comes to neuron
        connections. The wider it is the more times you have done the task, the
        narrower the road the less you have done it and more chance for the road
        to break.
      </p>
      <p class="question">
        Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        <a href="https://www.berkeleywellbeing.com/neuroplasticity.html"
          >This site </a
        >has a plethora of information regarding neuroplasticity. It has opened
        my eyes about getting parts of your brain to be repurposed and used for
        a new ability. For example, people that have suffered a stroke often
        lose function of their left hand. If you train hard enough, you can
        repurpose part of your brain to get your left hand to function again.
      </p>
      <h2>Research Growth Mindset</h2>
      <p class="question">Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</p>
      <p class="answer">
        Growth mindset is having the understanding that your abilities have the
        power to level up by doing challenges. This is quite relevant as a
        single persons ability is not fixed as long as the person continues to
        challenge themselves and not be down when hit with a challenge that is
        higher than their current level.
      </p>
      <p class="question">
        In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        It wasn’t all too surprising that this was the case with growth mindset
        but this gives me the confidence to be able to change further and now
        have some evidence that this actually can work.
      </p>
      <p class="question">
        How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        I will do challenges that are beyond my level. If I see something too
        hard, I need to understand that maybe I can’t solve the issue just yet,
        but I will. As long as I have determination to do so.
      </p>
      <p class="question">
        Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUWn_TJTrnU">This video</a>
        shows two versions of a person, one with fixed mindset and the other
        with a growth mindset. It is really quite interesting what can be
        achieved for someone with a growth mindset and how closed off a fixed
        mindset person will be.
      </p>
      <p class="question">
        Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your
        learning plan and strategy.
      </p>
      <p class="answer">
        I’m not sure if they will change my learning plan or influence a certain
        way. Looking at the way my learning plan is, without knowing what a
        growth mindset was or what neuroplasticity is my learning plan had
        already encompassed these ideas. My strategy is to gain knowledge and
        skill, and even after the course is done continue to learn and
        understand what will be required from me to be competent. I want to
        continue learning and become a better me, everyday I study I am learning
        something new. That is proof that you can teach an old dog new tricks
        (I’m not that old but you get the gist of it).
