        <h1>Best practices associated with using Classes vs IDs</h1>
        <p>
          To talk about the best practices for Classes and IDs we first need to
          talk about CSS specificity. This is the hierarchy that is in place to
          determine what CSS code will have precedence over the other. MDN Web
          Docs has this below definition for specificity.
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
          Specificity is the algorithm used by browsers to determine the CSS
          declaration that is the most relevant to an element, which in turn,
          determines the property value to apply to the element. The specificity
          algorithm calculates the weight of a CSS selector to determine which
          rule from competing CSS declarations gets applied to an element.
        </p>
        <p>
          That’s a mouthful, isn’t it? Let’s simplify it so we’re all on the
          same page. CSS is code for websites which provides the design
          instructions to your internet browser on how to display the website.
          It’s like if you worked at a Pizza shop and the manager tells you how
          to make and present the pizza for the end customers. In the case of a
          pizza shop they have standards on what the end customer will see. When
          making the pizza the boss will give you instructions for each pizza
          flavour, it could be how many toppings, what toppings, sauces etc.
          Likewise, in CSS we need to add instructions for things like colour,
          type of font, how big the images on the page are, where they sit on
          the page etc. When you’re building these websites, you must add
          ingredients to spice things up because a plain pizza base is really
          not going to be anyone’s cup of tea. This is where Classes and IDs
          come into play.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we simplify this down, both Classes and ID are used to style html
          code (our pizza base) and have different weights attached to them.
          Depending on which one weighs the most, the code overwrites the style
          of the other. In this explanation we’re going to forget about the
          pizzas. Let’s talk about weight. Let’s say there’s a competition of
          who weighs the most, the ID selector has a weight of 100kg, and Class
          selector has a weight of 50kg. From that alone we can tell that the ID
          selector at 100kg is going to win and have precedence over the lighter
          50kg Class selector.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can see this in the below test. Our h1 element has two selectors,
          one for Class and one for ID applied in HTML.
        </p>
        <img
          class="html-snippet"
          src="/images/html-class-and-id.png"
          alt="Snippet of HTML code"
        />
        <p>
          In our CSS stylesheet we use ‘#’ to address IDs followed by the value
          we give to it; in this case I gave the ID a value of ‘blue’.
          Similarly, to address class selectors you use ‘.’ Followed once again
          by the value which I have put as ‘red’.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since CSS runs code from top to bottom, like how we read a block of
          text, from top to bottom, our h1 element should show the background
          colour of red since that was the last line of code to be read by the
          browser.
        </p>
        <img
          class="css-class-id"
          src="/images/class-vs-id-css.png"
          alt="Code snippet from CSS for Class and ID"
        />
        <p>
          But, due to the weight of the ID at a whopping 100kg, the browser
          determines that it has precedence over the smaller petite 50kg Class
          selector and thus our Hello World! H1 header will be showing the
          colour blue.
        </p>
        <img
          class="id-winner"
          src="/images/id-selector-wins.png"
          alt="running code in browser example - ID overrides Class"
        />
        <p>
          Using the example above, you can see that the ID outweighs the Class
          selector. This means you could write code and style with class
          selector but if you want specific elements being overwritten you can
          use the ID selector and address the specific styles that way.
        </p>
        <p>
          A key difference with ID and Class is that IDs are unique and can only
          be used once in the HTML page whilst classes can be reused as many
          times as required. This means if you have an element in your HTML code
          that is only going to appear just once, you are safe to use the ID
          selector. If you are planning to reuse the selector multiple times in
          your HTML code you should use the Class selector. ID will in most
          cases be used only sparingly. For example, if you have 5 tables of
          data in your HTML code and you want them all to look the same, you
          would add class selectors to each table in HTML and then style them in
          CSS using just one Class “.table” selector. If you were to use ID
          selector you would need to address each table individually with the
          unique IDs to be styled. E.g “#table-1”, “#table-2” “#table-3” and so
          forth.
        </p>
        <p>
          In conclusion, it’s likely best to use ID very sparingly, in most
          cases parts of your website are going to reused over and over again,
          it will make coding the website a lot more simple and if someone goes
          to read your code for the website it will save them a lot of
          headaches.
